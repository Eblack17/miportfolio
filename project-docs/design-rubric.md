# Design Rubric: Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This design rubric establishes a structured framework for evaluating the design quality of the portfolio website. It provides objective criteria to assess various aspects of the design, identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, and ensure alignment with project requirements and industry best practices.

The rubric is designed to be used throughout the design and development process, from initial concepts to final implementation, providing consistent standards for review and iteration.

## How to Use This Rubric

### When to Apply

- **Initial Design Review**: Evaluate design concepts and mockups
- **Development Checkpoints**: Assess implementation at key milestones

- **Post-Launch Refinement**: Identify areas for future improvement

### Evaluation Process

1. Rate each criterion on a scale of 1-5
2. Multiply each score by the assigned weight factor
3. Calculate the weighted average for each category
4. Calculate the overall weighted score
5. Document strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
